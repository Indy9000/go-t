## Installation

In case you have [Go](https://golang.org/) 1.11+ installed:

```bash
go get github.com/cbrgm/go-t
```

You can also download precompiled binaries. See [Releases](https://github.com/cbrgm/go-t/releases).

## Configuration

Create a configuration directory with a default configuration for go-`t`.

    t init

The configuration file can be found at `~/.trc/config.json`.

[go-`t`](https://github.com/cbrgm/go-t) communicates with the Twitter API v1.1 to retrieve information. You will need to create an account on the Twitter developer website and credentials to use the Twitter API. Twitters API requires OAuth for all of its functionality, so you'll need a registered Twitter application.

Creating a developer account is quickly done.

1.  Go to <https://dev.twitter.com/user/login> and log in with your Twitter username and password. If you don't have a Twitter account yet, click on the Sign up link below the Username field.

2.  Go to the Twitter application page at <https://dev.twitter.com/apps> and click `Create a new application`. Follow the instructions on the screen. Enter an application name, description and website.

3.  Click the `Key and Access Tokens` tab to collect the credentials for your Twitter developer account. Click `Create my access token` at the bottom of the page. The following values are needed to add your Twitter account to go-`t`:

-   `Consumer Key`
-   `Consumer Secret`
-   `Access Key`
-   `Access Secret`

With the following command you add an account with the alias `foo` to be used by go-`t` (Important: `foo` is **not** your Twitter account name, but just an alias used by go-`t` to identify your credentials).

Follow the setup instructions and add your account:

    t accounts add foo

## Usage Examples

## Acknowledgements

go-`t` was initially started by Christian Bargmann.

This project is inspired by [sferik/t](https://github.com/sferik/t), a command-line power tool for Twitter. go-`t` uses the [dghubble/go-twitter](https://github.com/dghubble/go-twitter) library to communicate with the Twitter API. Many thanks to both projects, you are doing a great job!
